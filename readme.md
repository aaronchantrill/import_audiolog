# Import Audiolog - Speech to Text Trainer

<PluginLogo/>

Allows the user to import and merge an audiolog archive created by the Archive Audiolog plugin. The hope is that this makes it easier to save audio transcriptions when refreshing Naomi, and possible to bring your audiolog archive with you to train a new machine to your voice.
